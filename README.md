# bkk-planner
small personal project, originally created as programming homework

route planner application for public transport written in C using GTFS-files for input

`legacy.c` contains the original code i made for uni

the program works by transforming the GTFS input into a single text file, and then using the content of that file to create a static data structure. `reader.c` creates this markup file
